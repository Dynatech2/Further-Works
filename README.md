# Integrate Temperature, Weather, and Air Quality Data on Maps with Database Storage in ThingsBoard

## Overview

This project aims to integrate **temperature**, **weather**, and **air quality** data into a ThingsBoard map widget. The data will be collected and visualized on a map in ThingsBoard. Additionally, the collected data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database for future analysis.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Add temperature, weather, and air quality data to the ThingsBoard map widget.
- Create a new PostgreSQL database to store the collected data.
- Ensure that data is automatically transferred from ThingsBoard to the PostgreSQL database for storage and reference.

## Tasks/Checklist

Below is a detailed breakdown of the task with specific steps for implementation:

- [ ] **Add temperature, weather, and air quality data to the ThingsBoard map widget**: Visualize this data on the map in real-time.
  
- [ ] **Create a new PostgreSQL database for storing the data**: 
  - The database will store the following data:
    - Latitude (location)
    - Longitude (location)
    - Temperature
    - Weather conditions
    - Air quality index
  
- [ ] **Ensure automatic data transfer from ThingsBoard to the database**:
  - Automate the process of sending data from ThingsBoard to PostgreSQL.

- [ ] **Store map location data (latitude, longitude) with sensor readings**:
  - Save location coordinates along with temperature, weather, and air quality readings in the PostgreSQL database.
  
- [ ] **Test and verify the data visualization on the map and database storage**:
  - Ensure that the data is correctly visualized on the ThingsBoard map.
  - Verify that the data is properly stored in the PostgreSQL database.

## Labels

This project includes the following labels to categorize the task:

- **enhancement**: For adding new features.
- **backend**: For database and data handling.
- **database**: For tasks related to PostgreSQL.
- **integration**: For the connection between ThingsBoard and PostgreSQL.
- **ThingsBoard**: For tasks related to the ThingsBoard platform.

## Assignees

- Assign the task to yourself or team members who will be responsible for implementing these features.

## Milestone

This project can be part of the following milestone:
- **Database Integration**: To track the completion of the database setup and integration with ThingsBoard.
- **Map Visualization**: To track the visualization of data on the ThingsBoard map widget.

## Future Considerations

- Implement additional environmental data types (e.g., humidity, wind speed).
- Set up alerts for specific temperature, weather, or air quality thresholds.
- Enable historical data analysis and map visualization.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thingsboard-map-database-integration.git
